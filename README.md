## Features

- Search for weather by city name.
- Displays the temperature, weather description, and an icon representing the current weather.
- Shows the current date.
- Uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time weather data.

- Python 3.x
- Django
- Requests library

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/Manish-123m/Weather-App.git
